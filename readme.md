# DESCRIPTION
### Easy talk is a platform that links people who need mental health services to professional counsellors and therapists.Due to the increase in the rate of suicides and people taking each others lives we felt that it would really help to have a platform where people can come and share their burden and find someone to guide and listen to them.We should take care of our mental health the same way we take care of our body.
